stream-srb
==========

Script-Set for starting and stopping audiostreams via jack and darkice. Prerequisite is a correct running jack/Qjackctrl. The scripts stream-start.sh and stream-stop.sh can be executed with Qjackctrl. Therefore register the scripts in the optionstab of Qjackctrl (after starting and by stopping jack).

Thanks to Niels Dettenbach - nd@syndicat.com who wrote the darkice-init-script.
